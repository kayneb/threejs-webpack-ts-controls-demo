# three.js + react + typescript FPS controls demo

![screenshot sample of app](docs/sample.png)

This serves as a basis for a three.js project using webpack and typescript. This is my first toy project using three.js, react, etc and I borrowed heavily from some of the three.js examples like minecraft and pointerlock.

You can find a [live demo running here](https://levpaul.com/threedemo)

Usage:

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm run start

$ npm run build

$ ls -l
total 600
