# three.js + webpack + typescript FPS controls demo

This serves as a basis for a three.js project using webpack and typescript. This is my first toy project using three.js and I borrowed heavily from some of the three.js examples like minecraft and pointerlock.

Usage:
```bash
$ npm install

$ npm run start

$ npm run build

$ ls -l
total 600

-rw-r--r-- 1 levi levi    519 Jan  2 15:33 index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 levi levi    698 Jan  2 15:33 main.css
```
